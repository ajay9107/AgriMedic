# AgriMedic
Agri-Medic is a modern web-based agricultural assistance platform designed to connect farmers with agricultural experts and shop owners, enabling faster problem resolution and sustainable farming practices. Built using Spring Boot and MySQL for the backend, and React.js, Vite, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, the system provides a responsive and intuitive interface for managing crop issues, expert consultations, and product listings from a single platform.

In the farming sector, delays in expert consultation, inefficient communication, and lack of real-time issue tracking often lead to reduced crop yield and economic loss. Agri-Medic addresses these challenges by offering a centralized dashboard that delivers real-time updates, enhances coordination between farmers, experts, and shop owners, and optimizes resource utilization to improve agricultural productivity.
